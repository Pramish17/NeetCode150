Write down your intuition before coding — what's the input, output, constraints, edge cases?

Don't jump into coding right away. Think, then code.

Review your solved problems weekly. Editing and refactoring solutions builds real mastery.

Teach someone (or pretend to) — if you can explain it, you know it.

Keep a DSA journal: write solutions, mistakes, optimizations.
